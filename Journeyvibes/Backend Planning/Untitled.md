If you want the **icon to be associated with the section** rather than individual list items, and for that icon to be reflected across all items in that section, you can modify the database design slightly. The key is to move the **icon** from the `package_section_items` table to the `sections` table, so that the icon is linked to the section itself.

Here’s how you can adjust the design:

### Updated Database Schema

1. **Travel Packages Table**: Stores general information about the travel package.

sql

Copy code

`CREATE TABLE travel_packages (     id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,     title VARCHAR(255),     description TEXT,     price DECIMAL(10, 2),     created_at TIMESTAMP,     updated_at TIMESTAMP );`

2. **Sections Table**: This table stores the different section types (e.g., "Highlights", "Packing List", "Inclusion", etc.) and their associated icon.

sql

Copy code

`CREATE TABLE sections (     id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,     name VARCHAR(255),  -- e.g., 'Highlights', 'Packing List', 'Inclusion', etc.     icon VARCHAR(255),  -- icon URL or class name (e.g., 'icon-highlights.png' or 'fa fa-icon')     created_at TIMESTAMP,     updated_at TIMESTAMP );`

3. **Package Sections Table**: Links **travel_package** and **section** tables, indicating which sections belong to which package. This table allows each package to have multiple sections.

sql

Copy code

`CREATE TABLE package_sections (     id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,     travel_package_id INT,     section_id INT,     created_at TIMESTAMP,     updated_at TIMESTAMP,     FOREIGN KEY (travel_package_id) REFERENCES travel_packages(id),     FOREIGN KEY (section_id) REFERENCES sections(id) );`

4. **Package Section Items Table**: Stores the list items for each section, but now the **icon is inherited from the section**. Each list item will display the icon associated with its section, so there's no need to store the icon here.

sql

Copy code

`CREATE TABLE package_section_items (     id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,     package_section_id INT,  -- Links to package_sections table     item_text TEXT,          -- Text of the list item (e.g., "Visit the Eiffel Tower")     created_at TIMESTAMP,     updated_at TIMESTAMP,     FOREIGN KEY (package_section_id) REFERENCES package_sections(id) );`

### How This Works

1. **Add a Package**: Create a travel package (e.g., "Paris Tour"). This is stored in the `travel_packages` table.
    
2. **Add Sections to the Package**: Create sections like "Highlights", "Packing List", "Inclusion", etc., in the `sections` table. Each section has an associated **icon**.
    
3. **Add Items to Sections**: For each section (e.g., "Highlights"), add list items (e.g., "Visit the Eiffel Tower", "Walk along Champs-Élysées"). The icon for each section will automatically be applied to the list items.
    

### Example Data Flow:

- **Travel Packages Table** (Example Row):
    
    - `id: 1, title: 'Paris Tour', description: 'A fun trip to Paris', price: 1500.00`
- **Sections Table** (Example Rows):
    
    - `id: 1, name: 'Highlights', icon: 'icon-highlights.png'`
    - `id: 2, name: 'Packing List', icon: 'icon-packing-list.png'`
    - `id: 3, name: 'Inclusion', icon: 'icon-inclusion.png'`
    - `id: 4, name: 'Exclusion', icon: 'icon-exclusion.png'`
- **Package Sections Table** (Example Rows):
    
    - `id: 1, travel_package_id: 1, section_id: 1` (Paris Tour has "Highlights")
    - `id: 2, travel_package_id: 1, section_id: 2` (Paris Tour has "Packing List")
    - `id: 3, travel_package_id: 1, section_id: 3` (Paris Tour has "Inclusion")
    - `id: 4, travel_package_id: 1, section_id: 4` (Paris Tour has "Exclusion")
- **Package Section Items Table** (Example Rows):
    
    - `id: 1, package_section_id: 1, item_text: 'Visit the Eiffel Tower'`
    - `id: 2, package_section_id: 1, item_text: 'Walk along Champs-Élysées'`
    - `id: 3, package_section_id: 2, item_text: 'Toothbrush'`
    - `id: 4, package_section_id: 2, item_text: 'Sunscreen'`

### How This Reflects the Icon on the List

Since the **icon** is now associated with the **section** (in the `sections` table), every list item in that section will "inherit" the icon. You don't need to specify the icon for each list item; it will automatically be reflected from the section.

For example:

- The **"Highlights"** section has the icon `'icon-highlights.png'`.
- Every item in the "Highlights" section (like "Visit the Eiffel Tower") will display this icon.

### Updated Laravel Eloquent Model Setup

In Laravel, you can now define relationships to reflect this structure:

1. **`TravelPackage`** model:
    - A package has many sections (through `package_sections`).
    - A package has many items (through `package_section_items`).

php

Copy code

`class TravelPackage extends Model {     public function sections()     {         return $this->belongsToMany(Section::class, 'package_sections');     } }`

2. **`Section`** model:
    - A section can belong to many packages.
    - A section has many items (through `package_section_items`).

php

Copy code

`class Section extends Model {     public function packages()     {         return $this->belongsToMany(TravelPackage::class, 'package_sections');     }      public function items()     {         return $this->hasManyThrough(PackageSectionItem::class, PackageSection::class);     } }`

3. **`PackageSection`** model:
    - A package section belongs to one package and one section.
    - A package section has many items.

php

Copy code

`class PackageSection extends Model {     public function package()     {         return $this->belongsTo(TravelPackage::class);     }      public function section()     {         return $this->belongsTo(Section::class);     }      public function items()     {         return $this->hasMany(PackageSectionItem::class);     } }`

4. **`PackageSectionItem`** model:
    - A package section item belongs to a package section.

php

Copy code

`class PackageSectionItem extends Model {     public function section()     {         return $this->belongsTo(PackageSection::class);     }      // Retrieve the icon for the section     public function getIconAttribute()     {         return $this->section->section->icon;     } }`

### Benefits of This Approach

1. **Icon Inheritance**: The icon is associated with the section, and all list items in that section inherit the icon. This ensures consistency, and you don’t need to duplicate the icon for each item.
    
2. **Dynamic Section Management**: You can easily add new sections (like "Inclusion", "Exclusion", etc.) and their respective icons without modifying the list items table.
    
3. **Scalability**: This setup allows you to add more sections or list items to any package easily, and the icons are always correctly reflected for each section's list items.
    
4. **Maintainability**: If you need to change an icon for a section (e.g., updating the icon for "Highlights"), you only need to modify the `sections` table, and all list items for that section will automatically reflect the updated icon.
    

This approach gives you a clean, flexible solution for managing sections and their associated list items, along with the icons linked to sections.
